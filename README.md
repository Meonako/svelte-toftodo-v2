# ToF todo list in SvelteKit

Tower of Fantasy 'TODO' List. Featuring Daily, Weekly, Monthly

# Why / What's this for?

I tend to forget thing when the game don't put a red dot notification on it. That's why this was created.

# TODO (Should be done in like a month if I'm not lazy)

- Styling (Current one is sh*t)
- Others category (e.g. Battle Royale)
- Page for each category
- More detail in each category (e.g. Mirroria Funzone place)
- Settings

# Usage

> Visit [the website](https://www.kawaiiwaifu.ml) or host it yourself or locally.

There are 3 kind of checklist  
- **Button** - `Left click` to increase the value. `Right click` to decrease the value.
- **Checkbox** - Just a checkbox. Self explanatory
- **Number box** - Currently only `Support Points` is this kind. which you can enter the number yourself or use the `Button` kind below the box

# Q & A

- Why is it v2?
  > v1 is build with `Svelte` (not Kit and I didn't upload it anywhere) so I recreated it in `SvelteKit` and uploaded it here
